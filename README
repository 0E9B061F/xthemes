'xt' is a simple tool for managing X resource color themes. A 'theme' is simply
a configuration file containing X resource directives. It's assumed these
directives will create a color theme. Themes are stored in ~/.Xthemes. The
theme currently in use is linked to from ~/.current.theme

A collection of themes can be found at http://xcolors.net -  to use one of
these, download the color theme into '~/.Xthemes', then run 'xt set NAME',
where name is the name of the theme you downloaded. Can't remember the exact
name? Run 'xt list' to see a list of available themes. Any affected programs
will have to be restarted before the change takes effect.
